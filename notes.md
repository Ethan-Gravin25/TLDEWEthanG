Notes
5.1

Dopamine gives you happiness, experience it whenever something you like happens.
Many people get addicted to games or other internet things because of dopamine.
Many harmful and also good things that are gained from computing like people being addicted and other people being helped.

Action
1. It can help automation in society in things like factories or other positions, it can help make things more efficient with things like self driving cars eventually, and it can help mathematicians or other people with very hard jobs. Some harmful things are that it might take jobs from certain people, it might lead to complete reliance on technology, and it puts people's personal info in very easily reachable places.
2. I feel like the dopamine issue is definitely real. There've been many time when I knew I could've hung out with friends or family but I instead stayed inside doing what things like playing videogames. I feel like dopamine is definitely a problem but not too bad of an issue. 

5.2

Digital divide doesn't let a lot of people with less access to electronics access the internet.
Digital divide isn't good. People won't be able to access things on the internet because of the divide in technology or income etc.

Action
1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by learning how it all works. Someone who knows how to code and work around the internet is a lot more powerful than your average user. 
2. Someone who is empowered can warn other people who are not empowered about the dangers of the internet or even teach the unempowered person a little bit about the internet. 
3. There is some red tape blocking CSP at my school. You need a personal laptop that isn't a chromebook, it's an AP class so some people won't want to take it, some people can't pay for internet at home and won't be able to do much work, etc. Elsewhere, there are a lot more barriers. Many places don't have connection to the internet at all and many don't have the technology we have. 

5.3
There is a lot of biaas in computing, it can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional bias can be used by a company to try to make a product or a site more accessible to a certain age/race. Unintentional bias can be created by a company on accident, like accidentally creating a color scheme thats more appealing to younger children and less appealing towards older adults. 

5.4 
Crowdsourcing is collecting information for a product or project by a lot of people and various sources. Croudsourcing can be good because you can get a wide variety of inputs and opinions to help shape your program in the most inclusive and most wanted way for the people.
