There is a lot of biaas in computing, it can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional bias can be used by a company to try to make a product or a site more accessible to a certain age/race. Unintentional bias can be created by a company on accident, like accidentally creating a color scheme thats more appealing to younger children and less appealing towards older adults.

1. I don't believe the owner of the computer thought this was actually racism. Having an error like that is something that seems like it would happen naturally and if it came out that Windows did it on purpose they would lose all their credibility. Even if someone coded this feature and did all this on purpose, it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to fix, it's probably just a glitch that no one noticed. It's not really harmful, it isn't causing anyone harm and it isn't hurting people. It's just a small inconvienence but it should still definitely be corrected as soon as possible. To produce a better outcome, make the camera track all kinds of people and maybe have more testing with people odf different races.

Crowdsourcing is collecting information for a product or project by a lot of people and various sources. Croudsourcing can be good because you can get a wide variety of inputs and opinions to help shape your program in the most inclusive and most wanted way for the people. 

Action
1. We could have class-wide surveys of what everyone wants in the future. The teachers could put out a servey of what the students like to do and think would be fair to do in the future and the teachers could use the students' opinions to make decisions that the public (students of compsci) would like.
2. My final project could definitely be effected by croudsourcing. We will definitely need to crowdsource in the future
