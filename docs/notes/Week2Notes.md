Many companies make money on patents, like Qualcomm. Anyone who uses Qualcomms works have to pay royalty, and they aren't allowed to use open source things when making their royalties because it would count as open source. Qualcomm uses BlackDuck to help make sure it doesn't use anything that will have bad effects for the company. Different licenses can allow different things to be done in a project.

1. I've said a lot of information when doing things in CSP. I had to make my slack account with some info, make a github with more info, and create a replit too. Many accounts were made and some info was given out, not much though. 
2. I feel like PII isn't too big of a deal if you know proper internet etiquette. There are many things that you learn over time about your PII on the internet with experience.
3. Good passwords are passwords that are harder to guess while bad passwords would be easy to guess, like 123456 in contrast to something else. 
4. Symmetric uses only one key while assymetric uses a pair of related keys to encrypt and decrypt a message. 
5. Password to access the raspberry pi. 
6. Suspicious emails that send a link to click in a text or email. I didn't click it thought, I think I'm smarter than that.
