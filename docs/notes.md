Notes
5.1

Dopamine gives you happiness, experience it whenever something you like happens.
Many people get addicted to games or other internet things because of dopamine.
Many harmful and also good things that are gained from computing like people being addicted and other people being helped.

Action
1. It can help automation in society in things like factories or other positions, it can help make things more efficient with things like self driving cars eventually, and it can help mathematicians or other people with very hard jobs. Some harmful things are that it might take jobs from certain people, it might lead to complete reliance on technology, and it puts people's personal info in very easily reachable places.
2. I feel like the dopamine issue is definitely real. There've been many time when I knew I could've hung out with friends or family but I instead stayed inside doing what things like playing videogames. I feel like dopamine is definitely a problem but not too bad of an issue. 

5.2

Digital divide doesn't let a lot of people with less access to electronics access the internet.
Digital divide isn't good. People won't be able to access things on the internet because of the divide in technology or income etc.

Action
1. Someone can empower themselves in a digital world by learning how it all works. Someone who knows how to code and work around the internet is a lot more powerful than your average user. 
2. Someone who is empowered can warn other people who are not empowered about the dangers of the internet or even teach the unempowered person a little bit about the internet. 
3. There is some red tape blocking CSP at my school. You need a personal laptop that isn't a chromebook, it's an AP class so some people won't want to take it, some people can't pay for internet at home and won't be able to do much work, etc. Elsewhere, there are a lot more barriers. Many places don't have connection to the internet at all and many don't have the technology we have. 

5.3
There is a lot of biaas in computing, it can be intentional or unintentional. Intentional bias can be used by a company to try to make a product or a site more accessible to a certain age/race. Unintentional bias can be created by a company on accident, like accidentally creating a color scheme thats more appealing to younger children and less appealing towards older adults. 

Action
1. I don't believe the owner of the computer thought this was actually racism. Having an error like that is something that seems like it would happen naturally and if it came out that Windows did it on purpose they would lose all their credibility. Even if someone coded this feature and did all this on purpose, it doesn't seem like it would be too hard to fix, it's probably just a glitch that no one noticed. It's not really harmful, it isn't causing anyone harm and it isn't hurting people. It's just a small inconvienence but it should still definitely be corrected as soon as possible. To produce a better outcome, make the camera track all kinds of people and maybe have more testing with people odf different races. 

5.4 
Crowdsourcing is collecting information for a product or project by a lot of people and various sources. Croudsourcing can be good because you can get a wide variety of inputs and opinions to help shape your program in the most inclusive and most wanted way for the people. 

Action
1. We could have class-wide surveys of what everyone wants in the future. The teachers could put out a servey of what the students like to do and think would be fair to do in the future and the teachers could use the students' opinions to make decisions that the public (students of compsci) would like.
2. My final project could definitely be effected by croudsourcing. We will definitely need to crowdsource in the future 

5.5
Many companies make money on patents, like Qualcomm. Anyone who uses Qualcomms works have to pay royalty, and they aren't allowed to use open source things when making their royalties because it would count as open source. Qualcomm uses BlackDuck to help make sure it doesn't use anything that will have bad effects for the company. Different licenses can allow different things to be done in a project. 

Action
I picked the MIT license for both my personal and group projects. The MIT license allows a lot of freedom for the users to do what they want with their code, which is why I picked it. 

5.6
There are many things on the internet that pose dangers for the users, like having their data be out in the open. You need to be safe with your data and only show things that wouldn't do you any harm. Multi-factor authentification is a good idea and don't click on suspicious links. 

Actions
1. I've said a lot of information when doing things in CSP. I had to make my slack account with some info, make a github with more info, and create a replit too. Many accounts were made and some info was given out, not much though. 
2. I feel like PII isn't too big of a deal if you know proper internet etiquette. There are many things that you learn over time about your PII on the internet with experience.
3. Good passwords are passwords that are harder to guess while bad passwords would be easy to guess, like 123456 in contrast to something else. 
4. Symmetric uses only one key while assymetric uses a pair of related keys to encrypt and decrypt a message. 
5. Password to access the raspberry pi. 
6. Suspicious emails that send a link to click in a text or email. I didn't click it thought, I think I'm smarter than that.
